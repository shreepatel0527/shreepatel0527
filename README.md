# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hello! I'm Shree Patel (she/her), an aspiring scientific software professional with a background in metallic and computational chemistry. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Carnegie Mellon University with minors in Creative Writing and Engineering Studies, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Molecular Science and Software Engineering at UC Berkeley.

## Professional Background
With a strong foundation in both scientific research and engineering, I have developed a diverse skill set that spans computational chemistry, machine learning, and software development. My experience includes designing and optimizing laboratory automation equipment, customizing imaging instruments, small molecule therapeutics, analytical LC-MS methods, and statistical theories. In addition to my technical roles, I have been actively involved in research ranging from molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic potential analysis to designing synthetic pathways for novel nanoclusters.

## Personal Interests
I enjoy running, skiing, baking, knitting, and exploring new destinations. I am also a poet and an artist. 

## Fun Facts
1. I danced competitively for 4 years, pushing through the pandemic and a variety of injuries
2. I'm allergic to most pets (but I really want to adopt a cat someday)
3. I've started knitting and crocheting recently, and the most complex thing I can make is a colorblock scarf
