# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hello! I'm Shree Patel (she/her), an aspiring scientific software professional with a background in metallic and computational chemistry. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Carnegie Mellon University with minors in Creative Writing and Engineering Studies, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Molecular Science and Software Engineering at UC Berkeley.

## Professional Background
With a strong foundation in both scientific research and engineering, I have developed a diverse skill set that spans computational chemistry, machine learning, and software development. My experience includes designing and optimizing laboratory automation equipment, customizing imaging instruments, small molecule therapeutics, analytical LC-MS methods, and statistical theories. In addition to my technical roles, I have been actively involved in research ranging from molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic potential analysis to designing synthetic pathways for novel nanoclusters.

## Professional Goals
All of my experiences are united by a passion for harnessing computational tools and innovative technologies to address complex scientific challenges. My current goal is to leverage my expertise in molecular science and software engineering to contribute to advancements in drug discovery and materials science. By combining my technical skills with a creative approach, I aim to drive impactful innovations and contribute to the scientific communityâ€™s progress.

## Personal Interests
I enjoy running, skiing, baking, and exploring new destinations. I aim to maintain a well-rounded and balanced life, which I find enhances my creativity and problem-solving abilities in both personal and professional contexts.

## Fun Facts
1. I danced competitively for 4 years, pushing through the pandemic and a variety of injuries
2. I'm allergic to most pets (but I really want to adopt a cat someday)
3. I've started knitting and crocheting recently, and the most complex thing I can make is a colorblock scarf
